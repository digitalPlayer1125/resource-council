## Deprecations and Removals

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

<h5 class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.7;"> 
    We’ve made several new deprecations and removals from Angular. 
    The Angular Package Format no longer includes ESM5 or FESM5 bundles, saving you 119MB of download and install time when running yarn or npm install for Angular packages and libraries. These formats are no longer needed as any downleveling to support ES5 is done at the end of the build process.
    Based on heavy consultation with the community, we are deprecating support for older browsers including IE 9, 10, and Internet Explorer Mobile.

## Angular Team Fixit

<h5 class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.7;"> 
    We’ve dramatically increased our investment in working with the community. In the last three weeks our open issue count has decreased by over 700 issues across framework, tooling, and components. We’ve touched over 2,000 issues, and we plan to make large investments over the next few months, working with the community to do even more.
