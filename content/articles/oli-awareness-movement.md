### You are the founder of the Oli Awareness Movement, an environmental NGO. How did this movement come into existence and what was your motivation behind starting it?

    Dr R Karpagam is the founder of the Oli Awareness Movement, an
environmental NGO founded in 2005 in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. One day
while walking on a road with the sun blazing down on her, she noticed that
there were very few trees on the roadside to provide shade. Resolving to do
something about the situation, she went to a nearby nursery to get saplings
that she could plant on the roadside. The very next day, she met the
Municipal Corporation Commissioner and received the necessary approvals
for her project. As time went by, she gathered other like-minded people and
started working for the conservation of the environment. The Oli Awareness
Movement was born.

### You started your movement in 2005. What has the long journey of 15 years been like for your movement? What were the most significant challenges that you faced?

<h5 class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.7;"> 
    The journey from 2005 to the present has not been easy. “We found it very
difficult to impress on the people the need for a cleaner environment”, she recounts. However,
she never lost sight of the goal. She made considerable efforts in organizing meetings with
nearby residents and cleaning staff. She educated them about the ill-effects of piled-up garbage
in the neighbourhood and taught them how to properly segregate waste. With time and
perseverance, her efforts bore fruit. Her locality of Ramnagar in Coimbatore became one of the
cleanest in the entire city.

### In addition to being an environmentalist, you also teach students and edit a monthly Tamil magazine -- activities which have brought you in close contact with children, young adults and rural women. How has your work impacted these diverse groups of people?

<h5 class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.7;">
She started editing a monthly Tamil magazine called “Namathu Kural” (“Our Voices”). She roped
in her friends from various professions to write columns for the magazine on a diverse set of
topics such as cookery tips, health, hygiene, forest conservation and even the English alphabet.
The magazine found its way into the hands of hundreds of rural women. For these
poorly-educated women, it was a boon. It made them more healthy, educated and
environmentally conscious.

### We at Resource Council are most passionate about conserving or developing resources such that minimum wastage occurs. Thus, we were extremely inspired by your work in reviving the Erumaalan Kuttai -- a brilliant real-life example of water conservation. How did you go about reviving it?

The Erulaaman Kuttai is a pond located in the foothills of Perumalmudi Hills. Choked by the
nearby farmers dumping garbage indiscriminately, the pond had run dry. Dr Karpagam decided
to take action. She launched a crowd-funding campaign to collect funds for the pond’s revival
while she waited for the district administration’s approval. After two long years, the approval
came and with the help of another trust, Nallaram, she brought the pond back to life. The
Erumaalan Kuttai, named after the buffaloes that used to visit the pond in the olden days, was
once again brimming with life.

### We are sure many people will be inspired by your story to take action. However, the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic has confined most of us to our homes. What are the things that people at home can do differently to conserve resources and the environment?

<h5 class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.7;">
Dr R Karpagam has three simple tips for those of us who are confined to our homes and wish to
take action to conserve nature. Make simple paper bags and use them in your dustbins instead
of polythene. Practice proper segregation of waste and teach it to all your family members. And
most importantly, learn to stay quiet and observe nature. That is the first step to loving and
ultimately conserving nature.
